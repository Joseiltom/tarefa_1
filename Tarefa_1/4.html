        One arm, one fist<br>
        One battle in the night<br>
        So pale, so stiff<br>
        Defeated by Tyr and his might<br>
        The raging thunderstrikes<br>
        May gods be with us<br>
        My sword of doom is wet<br>
        Around me blood, tears and death<br>
        My God of justice<br>
        (Revenge in your name)<br>
        Guide me to victory<br>
        (Victory and pain)<br>
        Remember the fallen<br>
        (The wicked brave)<br>
        Make it your day<br>
        Ha! Ha<br>
        For Tuesday<br>
        Ha! Ha<br>
        Ha! Ha<br>
        It's Tuesday<br>
        Ha! Ha<br>
        It's Tyr<br>
        My arm, his feast<br>
        Great jaws of fire<br>
        So brute, despise<br>
        Blood he desires<br>
        In moonlight Fenrir cries<br>
        I stole his freedom<br>
        Now Gleipnir holds him tight<br>
        Made out of beard, spit and breath<br>
        My God of justice<br>
        (Revenge in your name)<br>
        Guide me to victory<br>
        (Victory and pain)<br>
        Remember the fallen<br>
        (The wicked brave)<br>
        Make it your day<br>
        Ha! Ha<br>
        For Tuesday<br>
        Ha! Ha<br>
        Ha! Ha<br>
        It's Tuesday<br>
        Ha! Ha<br>
        It's Tyr<br>
        My God of justice<br>
        (Revenge in your name)<br>
        Guide me to victory<br>
        (Victory and pain)<br>
        Remember the fallen<br>
        (The wicked brave)<br>
        Make it your day<br>
        Ha! Ha<br>
        For Tuesday<br>
        Ha! Ha<br>
        Ha! Ha<br>
        It's Tuesday<br>
        Ha! Ha<br>
        It's Tyr<br>
